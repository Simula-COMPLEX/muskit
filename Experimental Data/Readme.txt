This folder contains the experimental data for the results reported in the paper. 

************************************************
We used the following quantum programs:
CE: Conditional Execution program
IQFT: Inverse Quantum Fourier Transform
LittleBV: Bernsteinâ€“Vazirani cryptography algorithm
QRAM: Quantum Random Access Memory

Corresponding to each program, there is a dedicated folder.
*************************************************

Within each folder, one can find the following folders and files:

Mutants folder: It contains all the generated mutants.
CE_program: It is the original program, whose mutants will be generated.
CE_test_oracle: This file contains program specifications including oracles.
results: contains the detailed results of execution for each mutant with All Input Coverage.
cleanResults: Contains the simplified results of execution.
testResults: Contains the results of checking test oracles according to the program specifications with the two types of test oracles.
